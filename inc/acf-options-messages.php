        *** IMPORTANT NOTE/WARNING ***
        If your options page includes very large field groups that use repeaters
        flex fields or clone fields that there is a lot of data in these fields
        using and object buffer on the page can very likely cause the use of too
        much memory and crash your options page.


        At the time that I am setting up this example it is currently not possible to
        modify an ACF Options Page beyond the settings in the options page and adding
        field groups.

        This file gives an example of how to insert content into several places in an
        options page.

        A note about the action hooks to use: You must know the action hook that will be used by
        WP to call the callback function when ACF uses add_menu_page() and add_submenu_page().
        The hook is not returned so you will need to figure out what it is.

        top level options page hook = "toplevel_page_{$acf_menu_slug}"

        if top level page redirects to first sub level page use sub options page slug

        sub options page hook = "{$acf_parent_slug}_page_{$acf_sub_page_slug}"

        If your having trouble with the hook, to figure out what the hook really is
        open the file
        /advanced-custom-fields-pro/pro/admin/options-page.php
        find the function html, currently on line 459
        add this code to the top of the function
        echo '<br><br>',current_filter(),'<br><br>';
        This will output the correct hook to use for your actions for the options page
        don't forget to remove the test code

    add_action('toplevel_page_{$theme-general-settings}', 'before_acf_options_page', 1);

        // insert something before the <h1>

        // insert something after the form
        $my_content = '<p>This will be inserted after the form</p>';
        $content = str_replace('</form>', '</form>'.$my_content, $content, $count);
